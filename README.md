## Prerequisites 

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher installed. Node.js is essential for running the server-side JavaScript code. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Running locally on your machine or hosted on a remote server. Version 4.x or higher is recommended for full compatibility with Mongoose and the application's database operations. For local development, you can install MongoDB from [MongoDB's official site](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). If you're using a remote MongoDB service, ensure it's accessible and correctly configured for use with this application.
- **Git**: Installed for version control. Git is necessary for cloning the repository and managing source code changes. Version 2.x or higher is recommended. If you haven't installed Git yet, you can find the installation instructions on the [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **A Text Editor or IDE**: Such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) version 1.50 or higher, which is recommended for editing the codebase. VS Code is a popular, free, and open-source editor that provides powerful features such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (code completion), and debug support. Download it from [Visual Studio Code's official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Please ensure that all prerequisites are properly installed and configured before proceeding with the setup and running of the "Waste To Taste" project.


## Getting Started 
To get Waste To Taste up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps: 
1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/Aluckyasian/WasteToTaste.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
cd WasteToTaste
3. **Install dependencies:**
 - For the client: ```cd client``` Then, ```npm install```
 - For the server: ```cd server``` Then, ```npm install``` 

4. **Setting up your environment variables:** 
In case you did not notice, the `.env` file has already been added and not hidden by the `.gitignore.` We decided to keep the `.env` file public so that the users and developers have easy access to all features without having to make any changes other than the self generated JWT key. In order to change the JWT key, please follow these insturctions: In the server directory, navigate to the `.env` file and replace `PRIVATE_KEY` with a secure secret for JWT.

6. **Set up connection with MongoDB Compass:**
Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your local MongoDB instance using the following URI (also provided in the `.env`) file: `mongodb+srv://wastetotaste222:sg85AQZc0zM7XePz@wastetotaste.g88qrko.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`. This will allow you to visually manage the app's database.

6. **Start the server:**
Open a new Terminal and Run:
- 1. ```cd server```
- 2. ```npm start```
7. **In another new terminal, start the client:**
- 1. ```cd client``` 
- 2. ```npm start```

The client will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
